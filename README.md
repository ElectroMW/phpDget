# phpDget
A very small PHP Tcp/Ip server daemon for PHP applications. 
Written in an OO-fashion around a small, simple, custom built framework. 

Still very much Alpha/Beta with some hard-coded values and some debug code.

I guess this will have no real-world applications but it was fun and infomative to make.
